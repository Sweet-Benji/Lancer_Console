**LANCER** is a mud-and-lasers tabletop RPG made by Massif Press set in the far future. The game also has a web application **COMP/CON** (located [here](https://compcon.app/)).

This app is a terminal-based application inspired by COMP/CON used to deliver backstory, current events, and other text-based information in an in-universe way.
